The Plate-Forme Intelligence Artificielle 2023 ([**PFIA 2023**](https://pfia23.icube.unistra.fr/)) has been held between the 3rd and the 7th of july 2023 in Strasbourg, France.
Since the [SDC team](https://sdc.icube.unistra.fr/en/index.php/Home) was responsible for organizing the event, I have been helping the staff in my capacity of PhD student.
