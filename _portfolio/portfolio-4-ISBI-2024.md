# Athens, Greece

The 21st International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging ([**ISBI 2024**](https://biomedicalimaging.org/2024/)) was held between the 27th and the 30th of may 2024 in Athens, Greece.

I have attended the conference, presenting a poster (with an attached short paper) titled *Multi-Scale Component-Trees for Enhanced Representation in Multiplex Immunohistochemistry Imaging*.
Details about the talk can be found [on the dedicated talk page](/talks/2024-05-ISBI-talk).

Here is a sample of pictures taken by myself all around the city during my stay in Athens (or *Athina* in Greek).

## Athina

## Atop Mount Lycabettus

*Mount Lycabettus* is the highest hill in Athina.
The conference hall being one block aways from the base of this hill, I thought it would be a good idea to finish on day by walking to the top.
There is a beautiful panorama of the entire city from the mountains to the Agean sea.

## Around the Acropolis

I have not visited the hill of the *Acropolis* bu I took the time to walk around it when going back the the hotel.
