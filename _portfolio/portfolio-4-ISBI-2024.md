# Athens, Greece

The 21st International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging ([**ISBI 2024**](https://biomedicalimaging.org/2024/)) was held between the 27th and the 30th of may 2024 in Athens, Greece.

I have attended the conference, presenting a poster (with an attached short paper) titled *Multi-Scale Component-Trees for Enhanced Representation in Multiplex Immunohistochemistry Imaging*.
Details about the talk can be found [on the dedicated talk page](/talks/2024-05-ISBI-talk).

Here is a collection of pictures taken by myself all around the city during my stay in Athens.
