The IAPR Third International Conference on Discrete Geometry and Mathematical Morphology ([**DGMM 2024**](https://dgmm2024.dimai.unifi.it/)) was held between the 15th and the 18h of april 2024 in Firenze, Italy.

I have attended the conference, presenting a long paper titled *Multi-Scale Component-Tree: A Hierarchical Representation for Sparse Objects*.
Details about the talk can be found [on the dedicated talk page](/_talks/2024-04-DGMM-talk.md).

Here is a collection of pictures taken by myself all around the city during my stay in Firenze.
