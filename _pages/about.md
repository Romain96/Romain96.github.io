This is my personal webpage.
I am currently a temporary assistant lecturer at the [IUT Robert Schuman](https://iutrs.unistra.fr/), [Universit√© de Strasbourg](https://www.unistra.fr/).

My research work is focused on medical image processing, in particular histological image analysis.
I try to develop new graph-based hierarchical and morphological methods using mathematical morphology.

My teaching work is focused mainly on the basis of algorithm design, C# and Java programming, UML specification and graphical user interface design.
